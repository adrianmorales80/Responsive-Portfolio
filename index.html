            <p>Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for making intuitive, reliable, and scalable software. I am an effective communicator with a thirst for knowledge and hunger for continuous self-development in all aspects of programming.</p>
            <p>Pedagogy, education, and the evolution of technology are my passions. As a former 5th grade teacher, I saw firsthand how applications engage my students and the way coding logic helps them learn from their mistakes. Now, as a Client Success Manager, I see how exam software makes a wider impact in improving education for students, educators, and the institution as a whole.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the impact that technology makes in our daily lives, I am motivated to move into a software engineering career. At the moment, I am completing the Southern Methodist University Full-Stack Development bootcamp to build a foundation in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, and more. In the future, I am looking forward to working on a part-time Masters Degree in Software Engineering while also working as a Developer.</p>
